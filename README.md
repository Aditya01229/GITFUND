Voting based Crowdfunding for Social Impact Initiatives

Overview
This project implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) designed for crowdfunding social impact initiatives. The key feature of this platform is its voting mechanism, where community members can decide how funds are allocated to various projects. The system leverages blockchain technology to ensure that every decision is transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof, allowing for fair and democratic decision-making through token-based voting.

Key Features
1. Decentralized Voting Mechanism
Token-Based Voting: Users can vote for projects they want to support by using tokens. Each user is entitled to one vote per category, ensuring fairness and preventing vote manipulation.
One Vote Per Category Rule: To prevent users from manipulating results, the voting system allows only one vote per user in each category (e.g., Education, Health, Environment).
Transparent and Immutable: Voting results are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, accountability, and immutability.
2. Category-Based Voting
Projects are divided into predefined categories:
Education
Health
Environment
Arts & Culture
Technology
Users vote within each category, helping to prioritize projects that resonate most with the community.
3. Real-Time Progress Tracking
After the voting phase, the selected projects receive funds, and users can track the project progress in real-time via the blockchain.
4. Precautions Against Manipulation
One User, One Vote: Ensures fair voting by restricting each user to one vote per category, reducing the chance of manipulation.
Decentralized Execution: All voting logic and fund distribution are governed by smart contracts, guaranteeing unbiased results and preventing human interference.
